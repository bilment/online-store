# Project Title

## Description of the Project

This project is about making a simple online store that you use through commands. Customers can look at products, add or remove items from their cart, and finish buying their items with a checkout process.


## User Stories

List the user stories that guided the development of your application. Format these stories as: "As a [type of user], I want [some goal] so that [some reason]."

- As a customer, I want to view the available products, so I can decide what to buy.
- As a customer, I want to filter products by their ID, so I can easily find and purchase specific items.
- As a customer, I want to add items to my cart, so I can gather all the products I wish to purchase in one place before checking out.
- As a customer, I want to be able to remove items from my cart, so I can exclude any products I no longer wish to buy before completing my purchase.
- As a customer, I want to be able to check out the items in my cart, so I can finalize my purchase and complete the transaction.
